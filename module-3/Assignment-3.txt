Dictionary Functions

Objective: To practice working with Python dictionaries.

Task:
In this assignment, you will practice working with Python dictionaries by writing a Python program that performs various dictionary operations. You will create dictionaries with key-value pairs, access, modify, and delete dictionary elements, and iterate through dictionary keys and values to perform specific tasks.

Instructions:

Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for Python.

Create a Python program that does the following:

a. Create two or more dictionaries with key-value pairs. Each dictionary should contain information related to a specific topic or entity.

Example dictionary definitions:


student_info = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 25, "major": "Computer Science"}
employee_info = {"name": "Jane Smith", "employee_id": "EMP12345", "department": "HR"}


b. Implement dictionary operations to perform the following tasks:

Access and display values associated with specific keys.
Modify the value of a specific key.
Add new key-value pairs to a dictionary.
Delete a key-value pair from a dictionary.
Example operations:


# Access and display values
student_name = student_info["name"]
print("Student Name:", student_name)

# Modify a value
student_info["age"] = 26

# Add a new key-value pair
student_info["gender"] = "Male"

# Delete a key-value pair
del employee_info["employee_id"]


c. Implement a loop to iterate through the keys and values of a dictionary and perform specific tasks, such as counting elements or displaying information.

Example loop:


# Iterate through keys and values
for key, value in student_info.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")


Display the results of the dictionary operations and the output of the loop using the print() function. Include clear and informative output messages.

Save your Python program with an appropriate filename, such as "dictionary_functions.py."

Run your Python program to verify that it executes correctly and produces the expected results.

Submission:

After completing the assignment, save your Python program file (e.g., dictionary_functions.py).

Create a ZIP file containing your Python program file and any additional files if necessary.

Upload the ZIP file to the course's assignment submission portal.

Evaluation Criteria:

Successful execution of the program: Does the program run without errors?
Proper creation and manipulation of dictionaries.
Correctness of dictionary operations, including accessing, modifying, adding, and deleting key-value pairs.
Proper implementation of dictionary iteration.
Clear and informative output messages.
Adherence to the submission instructions.
