Tuple Manipulation

Objective: To reinforce the concept of tuples and their immutability.

Task:
In this assignment, you will reinforce your understanding of tuples, including their immutability, by creating a Python program that explores various aspects of tuples. You will create tuples with different data types, attempt to modify a tuple to demonstrate immutability, and perform tuple packing and unpacking operations.

Instructions:

Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for Python.

Create a Python program that does the following:

a. Define two or more tuples with different data types. Each tuple should contain a mix of integers, strings, floats, or other data types.

Example tuple definitions:


student_info = ("John Doe", 25, "Computer Science")
coordinates = (3.5, 7.2)


b. Attempt to modify one of the tuples by changing the value of an element. Observe and demonstrate that tuples are immutable by showing an error message or explaining why the modification is not allowed.

Example:


# Attempting to modify a tuple (this should result in an error)
student_info[1] = 26  # This will raise a TypeError


c. Implement tuple packing and unpacking operations:

Create a new tuple by packing values into it directly.
Unpack one or more tuples into separate variables.
Example tuple packing and unpacking:


# Tuple packing
coordinates = 3.5, 7.2

# Tuple unpacking
x, y = coordinates


Display the tuples and the results of tuple packing and unpacking using the print() function. Include clear and informative output messages.

Save your Python program with an appropriate filename, such as "tuple_manipulation.py."

Run your Python program to verify that it executes correctly and produces the expected results.

Submission:

After completing the assignment, save your Python program file (e.g., tuple_manipulation.py).

Create a ZIP file containing your Python program file and any additional files if necessary.

Upload the ZIP file to the course's assignment submission portal.

Evaluation Criteria:

Successful execution of the program: Does the program run without errors?
Proper creation and manipulation of tuples.
Demonstration of tuple immutability through an attempt to modify a tuple.
Correct implementation of tuple packing and unpacking operations.
Clear and informative output messages.
Adherence to the submission instructions.
