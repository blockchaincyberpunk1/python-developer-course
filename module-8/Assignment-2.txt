Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Objective: To explore data visualization techniques using Matplotlib.

Task:
In this assignment, students will create Python scripts to visualize data from a dataset using Matplotlib. They should plot various types of charts (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, histograms) to represent different aspects of the data, add labels, titles, and legends to enhance interpretability, and draw meaningful conclusions from their visualizations.

Instructions:

Instruct students to open their preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for Python.

Ask them to choose a dataset for data visualization. The dataset should be relevant to their interests or provided by the instructor.

Encourage students to load the chosen dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using the pandas library's read_csv() function. They should ensure that they understand the structure of the data and the meaning of each column.

Example code to load a CSV file:


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')


Guide students to identify the aspects of the data they want to visualize. They should choose appropriate types of charts (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, histograms) to represent these aspects.

Instruct students to use Matplotlib to create their visualizations. They can choose from various Matplotlib functions and customization options to create informative and visually appealing plots.

Example code to create a bar chart:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a bar chart
plt.bar(df['Category'], df['Count'])
plt.xlabel('Categories')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Bar Chart of Categories')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()


Encourage students to add labels to the axes, titles to the plots, and legends if applicable to make their visualizations more interpretable.

Ask them to create multiple visualizations to represent different aspects of the data. They can use subplots to display multiple plots in a single figure for comparisons.

Instruct students to write meaningful conclusions based on their visualizations. They should analyze and interpret the patterns, trends, or insights revealed by their charts.

Encourage them to include comments in their Python scripts to explain their code and the purpose of each visualization.

Ask students to submit the Python script containing their data visualization code, any generated plots, and a report summarizing their findings and conclusions drawn from the visualizations.

Assignment Variation:
To make the assignment more advanced, students can explore additional data visualization libraries such as Seaborn or Plotly, or they can visualize data in 3D for more complex datasets.

Submission:

After completing the assignment, students should create a ZIP file containing their Python script, any generated plots or visualizations, the report in a suitable format (e.g., PDF or Markdown), and any additional documentation.

Instruct them to upload the ZIP file to the course's assignment submission portal.

Evaluation Criteria:

Proper loading and understanding of the dataset.
Effective use of Matplotlib to create meaningful visualizations.
Clear and informative labels, titles, and legends on the visualizations.
Thoughtful and insightful conclusions drawn from the visualized data.
Adherence to the submission instructions.
